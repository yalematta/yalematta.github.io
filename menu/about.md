title: Hi there! Iâ€™m Layale

I'm an **Android Engineer** and a **Community Lover**.

Android
-------

I'm from Lebanon ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡§, currently based in Denmark ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° and working for [Storytel](https://mofibo.com/) ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. 

I've been developing for Android for over 5 years now (using Kotlin for the last 2 years). Iâ€™m a huge advocate of Kotlin and functional programming. <br> And I'm an enthusiast about mentorship, open source and knowledge sharing within the community. 

Community & Public Speaking
---------------------------

I enjoy connecting developers around me. I am currently co-organizing Tech events at [GDG Coast Lebanon](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-coast-lebanon/) where I plan lots of cool mobile events.

I also enjoy public speaking and sharing my experience with everyone. <br> You can checkout some of my slides and videos in the [Talking](/menu/talking.html) page. <br> Are you looking for speakers? Feel free to [email me](mailto:layale.a.matta@gmail.com) with details!

Questions? Feedback? Or just a chat? You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yalematta).
