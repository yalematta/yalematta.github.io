[Android 13](https://www.android.com/android-13/) has introduced a new feature that let you assign a different language to individual applications, allowing you to navigate each app with a specific language without the need to change the Language settings on your whole Android device.

While both **Preferences** and **Proto DataStore** allow saving data, they do this in different ways. One important feature is applied only when using **Proto DataStore**, and it is **Type Safety**. 

With **Proto DataStore** we don't have to use keys. Instead we define a schema using Protocol Buffers. And with Protocol Buffers we can persist **strongly typed data**.

One of the downsides of **SharedPreferences** and **Preferences DataStore** is that there is no way to ensure that keys are accessed with the correct type. Using **Proto DataStore**, we know what types are stored and we will just provide them.

## üîç What's Protocol Buffers? 

Protocol Buffers were developed by Google for storing and interchanging all kinds of structured information. They are used for **serializing structured data**. It is similar to XML and other similar data formats, but **it's smaller, faster and simpler**.

If you don't know what serialization is, it's the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored, like for example, a file or a memory data buffer.

### üë∑üèª How Protocol Buffers work?

We need to define how we want our data to be structured once, and the compiler will generate the source code for us to easily read and write the structured data. 

That said, with **Proto Datastore** we will serialize and save our custom data structure using Protocol Buffers and of course deserialize and read the values whenever we need to.

### ü§ø Let's dive 

In this simple [project](https://github.com/yalematta/datastore-demo), we are implementing the same _**Remember Me**_ functionality as in the previous post. We are currently using **SharedPreferences** to store this value and redirect the user to the Welcome screen once it's checked. We will migrate the code to use **Proto DataStore**.

To get your hands on the code, consider checking this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yalematta/datastore-demo). <br>
The final code is located in the [_proto_datastore_](https://github.com/yalematta/datastore-demo/tree/proto_datastore) branch.

## üè∑Ô∏è Define Protobuf schema 

In order to use **Proto Datastore** we will need to define our Protobuf schema in a new `.proto` file. So instead of creating a model class in Kotlin, we will define it in a Protobuf schema instead. And there's a **new syntax** that we need to follow when writing this schema.

We will install a plugin in Android Studio called **Protocol Buffer Editor** that will help us write the Proto file. Make sure to install it before creating your proto files.

<img src="../assets/img/protobuf_plugin.png" width="600"/> 

Once installed, we switch to our **Project View** and under **`app/src/main`** we create a new directory called **proto**. Inside this directory we create a new file **`user_prefs.proto`** where we define our Protocol Buffer schema as follows:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/cfa7afec0e8f9a72c08fe213b359182f.js"></script>

Let me walk you through this syntax:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Syntax

There are 2 versions for the Protobuff syntax: proto2 and proto3. You can check the [documention](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) for more info regarding these two different versions. In our case, we are going to use **proto3**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Options

Then, we are going to write 2 options:
First, our **`java_package`** name. We need it in order to tell our compiler where to generate our classes from this protocol buffer. 
The second option is **`java_multiple_files`**. We will set it to true and this means that we need to create a separate file for each top level **message** object of this proto file.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Message

The **message** keyword defines the data structure. And inside it, we define the members of this structure. As you may have noticed we have different primitive types  in this syntax. 

<img src="../assets/img/protobuf_types.png" width="600"/> 

By taking a look at the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3), we can learn that: int32 in Java represents an Integer, int64 a Long and bool is a Boolean.

We create an object **UserPreferences** with 2 member fields: a bool, a string and an int32. Don't be confused when you see these 1, 2 and 3. These are not actual values but unique numbers to identify our fields in the _message binary format_ and they **should not be changed** once our message object is in use.

## üîå Dependencies 

Before we continue let's place this **plugin** at the top of our build.gradle file.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/b7bfcee4e0dae16c35fd55530c32b527.js"></script>

Then we need to add two dependencies, one for Protobuf and one for Proto DataStore.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/dfcf0b37b4c885a207626f5bb25238a1.js"></script>

And finally at the end of our build.gradle file we configure Protobuf and we **sync our project**.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/bbece7f997ba217e93676b6e64038afb.js"></script>

Now that we have added this plugin, we should be able to see the automatically generated files by this plugin from our **`user_prefs.proto`** file. 

Rebuild the project to see those files inside the java (generated) folder. 

We find a new **UserPrefs** folder that represents our proto file,  and a **UserPreferences** class that represents our message object. Inside it we have java code that implements some getters and setters for this UserPreferences message object.

## ‚Ü™Ô∏è Serializer 

To tell DataStore how to read and write the data type we defined in the proto file, we need to implement a Serializer. The Serializer defines also the default value to be returned if there's no data saved yet.

Back in our project, we create a class called **UserPreferencesSerializer** which extends Serializer<UserPreferences>. We implement its two methods readFrom and writeTo. In these methods we define how we want to read and write this object into our DataStore.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/de4e14ae3e6c154cca432eecb31cd8e1.js"></script>

## üóÉÔ∏è DataStore Repository 

Next we create our Repository which we call **UserPreferencesRepository**.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/dc5d09a3f1fe116b673bc1b0e6c49db0.js"></script>

### üìã Read from DataStore 

We create a new variable called userPreferencesFlow of type Flow<UserPreferences>. We use our dataStore to read the data and catch exceptions if there is any and emit the default instance of UserPreferences in that case.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/0a71f274d6ad057bdddc2c9087fc9434.js"></script>

### üìù Write to DataStore 

We create the suspend updateUsername function which will update one field from our UserPreferences member values. We will call **`preference.toBuilder().`** and we choose the setter method that we need from our generated class.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/8df794025887336597365c5558a820d7.js"></script>

P.S: Don't forget to create a method to update each field.

### üÜë Clear DataStore 

To clear data, we can either clear the preferences all together or clear a specific preference by its method from our generated class.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/47c77317f29dee5b1a047bee985898c8.js"></script>

## ü§ôüèº Call it from the ViewModel 

In our **LoginViewModel**, we create a variable for our **UserPreferences**, read its data from our DataStore as a Flow and then convert it to LiveData.

Next we create a new function named **saveUserPreferences** and we pass to it the values that we want to update. We call viewModel scope and run the following code inside a coroutine since our update functions in our Repository are using Kotlin Coroutines.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/0ca185c7acc4ef45b170cfa476946d5f.js"></script>

**LoginViewModelFactory** is a ViewModelProvider.Factory that is responsible to create our instance of **LoginViewModel** later in our Activity. We will pass to it the **DataStoreRepository** which is need in **LoginViewModel**'s constructor.

## üî¨ Observe it in the Activity 

### üóÑÔ∏è Create DataStore 

In our Activity, we first create our userPreferencesDataStore and we initialize it and pass to it a file name as well as our Serializer class. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/55129c3f89abfc16731669495395347c.js"></script>

### üì¶ Migrate from SharedPreferences 

If we are migrating our existing data from the SharedPreferences, when creating our DataStore, we should add a migration based on the SharedPreferences name. 

And when creating the dataStore we need to update the DataStore builder and assign to the migrations parameter a new list that contains an instance of our SharedPreferencesMigration.

Define the mapping logic from SharedPreferences to UserPreferences inside your SharedPreferencesMigration.

DataStore will be able to migrate from SharedPreferences to DataStore automatically, for us. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/6c975819f7a3e1535f24863c9b20d4a0.js"></script>

Inside our onCreate function, we initialize our ViewModel and we observe our fields' values, so that whenever this data changes we will update it in its corresponding text field. 

And whenever we click our login button, we store the value from our editText and checkBox field and update it in our DataStore using the saveUserPreferences function.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yalematta/3c9193d6c6e1108c641d8a728f883472.js"></script>

## üí° Key Takeaways 

Now that we migrated to Preferences DataStore let's recap! 

**DataStore**:
- is a replacement for SharedPreferences
- has a fully asynchronous API using Kotlin coroutines and Flow
- guarantees data consistency
- handles data migration
- handles data corruption

DataStore has 2 different implementations: Preferences DataStore and Proto DataStore.

[**Preferences DataStore**](https://yalematta.dev/blog/preferences-datastore.html):
- stores and accesses data using keys

**Proto DataStore**:
- ensures Type Safety
- requires defining a schema using Protocol Buffers
